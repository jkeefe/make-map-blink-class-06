#Make Map Blink 6: Javascript & Charts

To get all of the files for this lesson, use the "Download Zip button over there --->"

###FILES USED: Everything in the folder "live demo" (included in this repo).

##First, a little html

- Open the file `index.html` with a text editor. The simpler the better. 
- If it's TextEdit, be sure to use "plain text" mode: Format --> Make Plain Text.
- Better to use TextWrangler (free) or TextMate (not free, but what I use) or Sublime Text (what many use, not free)

It's blank! Let's change that.

- For the first line, declare it an html file with this: `<!DOCTYPE html>`
- Almost all html commands have an open tag and a close tag, like `<strong>` (open) and `</strong>` (close)
- Type in the open and close tags for "html":

	<html>
	</html>
	
OK, now we need two more sections *between* those two tags: head and body:

	<html>
	
	<head>
	</head>
	
	<body>
	</body>
	
	</html>
	
Now, let's just test this out. Put 'Hello, world!' between the body tags.

	<body>
	Hello, world!
	</body>
